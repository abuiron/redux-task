# Redux Task

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Redux** for state management in a React application. The goal of this project is to showcase how Redux can be used to manage global state, allowing components to access and update shared data efficiently.

## Live Demo
You can view the live demo of the project here: [Redux Task](https://redux-task-by-at.netlify.app)

## Project Overview
The **Redux Task** project highlights how Redux can centralize and manage state in a React application. The project uses actions, reducers, and a global store to update and access state across different components, providing a more structured way to handle state changes.

## Key Features
- **Redux State Management**: Global state is managed using Redux's store, actions, and reducers.
- **Component Interaction**: Components can dispatch actions to update the global state or subscribe to changes in the state.
- **User Interface**: The app's UI is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap with React for the front-end.
  
## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For the structure and styling of the user interface.
- **Bootstrap**: To create a responsive and modern design.
- **React.js**: The front-end framework used for building the UI components.
- **Redux**: To manage the global state of the application.

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abuiron/redux-task.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
  ```bash
  cd redux-task

3. Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install

4. Start the development server:
  ```bash
  npm start

5. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.


## Learnings
This project helped me solidify my understanding of Redux as a state management tool, allowing for more predictable and maintainable state updates in a React application.

## Conclusion
The Redux Task project demonstrates the effective use of Redux to manage the state in a React application. Redux provides a scalable solution for complex state management, making the app easier to maintain and develop further.
